//      No code:            RANDOM_DIGITS = 0       RAID_CODE = ""
//      Fixed code:         RANDOM_DIGITS = 0       RAID_CODE = "12345678"
//      Random Code:        RANDOM_DIGITS = 4       RAID_CODE = "12345678"
//
//  "RANDOM_DIGITS" specifies how many of the first digits are randomized.
//  If it is less than 8, the remaining digits will be copies of the last digit.
//  This makes it easier to enter the code.

//  When using random codes, "RAID_CODE" is used to generate the starting seed.

//  Backup Save: (for soft-lock hosting)
//      If set to true, the game will load backup save upon soft-reset.
//  The idea here is to roll forward from the save frame to the shiny frame.
//  Once on the shiny frame (with the desired softlock), you enter and exit the
//  camp to setup a backup save on the shiny frame. That way, you can load the
//  backup save on the shiny frame while leaving the real save safely 3 or more
//  frames before.

//  This option only makes sense when SKIPS = 0.

//  not slow down the program.

//  Additional Raid Delay:
//      If you are farming a pokemon and the time between raids is too short to
//  join consecutive raids, use this to add time between raids. This extra wait
//  time is done after the code is entered, but before opening the lobby.

//  Alternate Games: (experimental feature)

//  Basically if you have both Sword and Shield on the same user and you wish
//  to host dens on both with the same settings.

//  Rollover Prevention
//
//  This option is only relevant if (SKIPS = 0).
//
//  If set to zero, this feature is disabled.
//  Otherwise, the program will touch the date at roughly this interval to
//  prevent the den from rolling over. This feature requres time-sync be disabled.

//  For each batch of eggs, attempt this many egg fetches.
//
//  This parameter works by dividing the incubation time by the # of fetch
//  attempts and doing a fetch at this interval. Therefore increasing this
//  number will decrease the time between fetches which also decreases the
//  chance of successfully fetching an egg. The optimal value is difficult to
//  determine and is dependent on many factors.
//
//  For fast hatching eggs like Magikarp, you may need to decrease this number
//  to as low as 1 or 2. This implies that it's impossible for fetching to keep
//  pace with hatching as is the case with manual hatching anyway.
//
//  The program will automatically reduce this number if it determines that it
//  is too large to function correctly.
//
//  If this is set to a non-integer, the program will vary the # of fetches
//  across batches so that they average out to the specified number.

//  If you see that the program is going into Y-COMM or there is less than 5
//  seconds of extra spinning after the last egg in the batch, please report
//  this as a bug. As a temporary work-around, you can increase this number.

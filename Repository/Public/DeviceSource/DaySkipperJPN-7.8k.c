/*  Pokemon Sword & Shield: JPN Date Skipper (7.8k)
 * 
 *  From: https://github.com/Mysticial/Pokemon-Automation-SwSh-Arduino-Scripts
 * 
 *      Please refer to the user manual for instructions and documentation.
 * 
 *  This program is experimental. Instructions are the same as DaySkipperJPN
 *  except that you must set the date to January 1, 2000. The hour must be set
 *  away from the DST missing hour.
 * 
 *  This program will run at ~7800 skips/hour at full speed. It will be able to
 *  tolerate single missed skips and maintain this full speed. However, if a
 *  large error happens (such as a trapping error), it will recover, but it will
 *  only be able to run at a degraded state of ~7500/hour.

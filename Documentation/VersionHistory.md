-  Re-added the atmega16u2 MCU because I'm stupid.
-  Fixed some settings options that broke during the refactor.

### 2020-05-17: 
-  Major refactoring of the build process.
-  Further tweaked date spamming for WattFarmer.
-  Increased box-change delay to improve stability of egg programs.

### 2020-05-16: 
-  The 4k skipper has been removed. It will be distributed in a separate package.
-  Fixed a minor issue where JPN egg hatching tolerance was always enabled.
-  Added a "Required Parameters" section to the instructions of each program to clarify what parameters need to be set properly to use the program.
-  Slightly tweaked timings for date spamming.
-  Moved a ton of box navigation timings into Settings.h so they're more easily configured.

### 2020-05-11: 
-  BeamReset now goes in-and-out of the game several times to flash the beam before it resets.
-  EventBeamFinder: Drop wishing pieces until you find an event den.
-  Added an option to make the egg programs work in Japanese.

### 2020-05-10:
-  Added MultiGameFossil (beta). Now you can revive fossils for more than 4.5 hours at a time by utilizing multiple saves!
-  BeamReset has been updated to require slow text. Apparently some Switches save extremely quickly - enough to break the program under fast text speeds.

### 2020-05-09:
-  Added BeamReset to make purple beams less painful.
-  Fixed some timings that could cause den rolling and rolling-auto-host to fail to reset the game.
-  Lot of minor timing changes.

### 2020-05-08: 
-  Added support for random raid codes to the auto-hosts.
-  Relaxed the box entry timings for all the egg programs.
-  Rolling auto-host start time no longer includes the 8 second lobby open wait. So now it starts closer to 2:00 now.

### 2020-05-06:
-  Recalibrated "TICKS_PER_SECOND" and adjusted it from 123 -> 125.
-  Fixed an issue in the egg hatchers where it can incorrectly back out all the way to the overworld on faster Switches.
-  Fixed some timings in the egg hatchers that broke after migrating the framework.
-  Fixed game entry timings when starting game requires internet.

### 2020-05-05: 
-  Moved "Settings.h" into the main folder so that it's more accessible.
-  Cleaned up "Settings.h" so that's clearer and better documented.
-  Added an option that will allow programs that soft-reset to work when starting the game requires checking the internet because the game isn't a physical cartridge and the Switch isn't the primary Switch.
-  The 7k skipper's is slightly faster again.
-  The 7k skipper's default auto-correction interval has been reduced from 500 to 250.
-  Adjusted some timings with the mass release to make it more reliable.

### 2020-05-03: (beta)
-  Slightly faster date spamming for watt farmer and den rolling.
-  Slightly modified timings for box operations in the egg programs.
-  The 7k skipper is about 1.6% faster. 

### 2020-04-29: 
-  Fixed EggHatcher which was broken by a refactoring.
-  Fixed the start-timer for AutoHostRolling to 2:00. Accidentally left it on 2:15 after hosting yesterday.
-  Added this ReadMe file.

### 2020-04-27: 
-  Lots of minor timing adjustments for all programs.
-  Another fix that hopefully fixes the no-code raids.
-  Added EggSuperCombined. Combines mass-release with EggCombined.
-  Added forbidden program GodEggItemDupe. Mass duplicate items with the God Egg.

### 2020-04-23: 
-  Relaxed the den entry timings for auto-hosting to hopefully fix the no-code problem.
-  Add warnings about messing with TV displays to all programs.
-  Updated documentation for EggCombined.

### 2020-04-21:
-  Fixed some timings with the egg programs to make them more reliable.
-  Fixed some timings with the WattFarmer to make them more reliable.
-  The WattFarmer's starting sequence is more optimized.
-  Renamed the two JPN day skippers to "DaySkipperJPN_4k" and "DaySkipperJPN_7k".
-  Slightly faster auto-correction logic for both day skippers.
-  The 7k skipper now asks for the current (real-life) month so that auto-corrections will land you back on a month with 31 days.
-  Added a global option to make the programs more tolerant of the system update window. This is disabled by default for den-rolling and auto-hosts since it affects performance.

### 2020-04-20: 
-  Added WattFarmer which is about 50% faster than Brainuuu's.
-  Den rolling is now better optimized.

### 2020-04-19: (beta)
-  Massive refactor of all programs to switch to a new controller framework.
-  The 4700 skipper has not been migrated since doing so would make it identical to the 7k skipper. For now, the public only knows (rumors) about the 4700 skipper. But they have no idea about the 7k skipper.

### 2020-04-18:
-  Refactor of a ton of code. So not a lot of functional changes.
-  Den rolling and FR-accepts are now faster.

### 2020-04-16:
-  DaySkipper_JP_Fast2: A new day skipper that runs at fucking like 7000/hour.
-  DenRoller and AutoHostRolling use a new method to roll the date.
  -  There no longer a constraint on your starting date.
  -  It rolls backwards first.
The idea here is that you'll be resetting the game on the target frame when you're done hosting that. So it's better to have your date correct at this point. In the past, if you forgot to fix the clock after rolling the den, every mon you caught would be in the future. Some of the timings for den rolling have also been tightened to make it faster.
-  New Program: AutoHostSleep - Similar to AutoHostAirplane, but it uses sleep instead of airplane mode. Thus it works while docked. But techinical limitations with the method mean that the program will wait 30 seconds before it starts hosting. Similarly, the artificial delay between raids cannot be skipped for the first raid.

### 2020-04-14:
-  EggHatcher and EggCombined now require that you have the cursor over "Pokémon" instead of the "Town Map".
-  Adjusted some timings in EggHatcher and EggCombined to improve reliability. (Rowlett was failing with EggCombined.)
-  Added SurpriseTrade: A super-dangerous program that will wonder trade entire boxes of Pokémon. :lul:
Brianuuu also dropped a new version of his Arduino programs which includes a lot of the stuff that we have here. Neither set of programs are strictly better than the other. Thus they will continue to complement each other.

### 2020-04-12: 
-  When connecting to the internet for auto-hosting, the cursor will be moved as far away as possible from the Link Trade and Surprise Trade buttons. This reduces the chances of a slow internet connection breaking the program in a way that initiates a trade.
-  Add warnings that unattended auto-hosting is not recommended due to accidental trade risk.
-  Improved documentation for all the delay parameters in the auto-hosts.

### 2020-04-11:
-  Auto-Hosts: Auto FR-accepts is now delayed by a few seconds to keep it from clipping the start of the lobby.
-  Auto-Hosts: The artificial delay between raids is suppressed for the first raid.
-  Tightened some timings for DenRoller and AutoHostRolling.*
-  EggCombined: Misc. reliability improvements.
-  EggCombined: The default # fetches/batch has been increased to 6.

### 2020-04-09: 
-  Added EggCombined. It's harder to use than EggFetcher and EggHatcher, but can be a lot more efficient.
-  Relaxed some timings in EggHatcher to make it more reliable.
-  Relaxed some more timings in the auto-hosts to improve reliability.

### 2020-04-06:
-  The FR-accepting auto-hosts have been merged into the regular ones as an optional feature. So it's back to two programs, AutoHostAirplane and AutoHostRolling.
-  The per-raid extra delay option has been added to the rolling auto-host as well. But it only make sense to use if you're hard-locked instead of rolling.
-  For the rolling auto-host, added the ability to select a 1st move. Now you can flex your hosting shiny!

### 2020-04-05:
-  Relaxed the timings of FriendDelete.
-  Add an option to the airplane auto-hosts to increase the time between raids. This makes farming more efficient when the raid cannot be cleared before the next raid starts.
-  Add FriendDelete to the makefile comments.
-  Clarified the instructions that you need to set USER_SLOT in order to pick the right account for auto FR-accepts.

### 2020-04-04:
-  Tweaked the EggHatcher incubation period equation. Should fix issue with Lapras not having enough time to hatch.
-  Add FriendDelete. Mass delete friends to clean up after auto-hosting with auto-FR accept.
The friend-deleter isn't super-well tested since it's a pain-in-the-ass to test.

### 2020-04-03:
-  Added AutoHostAirplaneFRs. Now both of the auto-hosts have automatic FR-accepting versions.
-  Minor code changes to everything.

### 2020-04-02: 
-  Added AutoHostRollingFRs: Rolling auto-host that will automatically accept friend requests.
-  Slightly tweaked timings for EggFetcher, DenRoller, and both auto-hosts.

### 2020-04-01: 
-  Loosened some timings that can sometimes cause the auto-host programs to not connect to the internet.
-  Loosened the timings for the box operations in the EggHatcher.
-  The EggHatcher now travels further to the right for added safety.
-  Speculative fix for an issue that can cause the egg programs to fail to fly back to Route 5.
-  Updated comments and instructions including some precautions.

### 2020-03-30:
-  Loosened some timings in DenRoller and the auto-hosts to make them more reliable. This helps fix some (recoverable) issues where it would fail to roll the correct # of times (and thus host the wrong frame) or will fail to enter a code.
-  The EggFetcher has been retuned. It now properly dodges the man on the bridge and has a higher chance of successfully fetching an egg on each fly-back.
-  EggHatcher timings have been updated to make it more reliable.

### 2020-03-29:
-  EggHatcher now uses the spinning method. I strongly recommend that you stay offline. One of the failure cases may result in it entering YCOMM and starting a trade.

### 2020-03-28b: 
-  In the JPN skipper, the default auto-recovery period has been increased to 200 skips.
-  Some refactoring of all the progs.
-  Added EggFetcher and EggHatcher.

### 2020-03-27: 
-  Fixed a bug where 0s in the code for auto-host might not work.
-  Added airplane auto-hosting for soft-locks.
-  Tweaked timings for various things.

### 2020-03-26: 
-  Fixed a bug in the DaySkipper_JP_Fast where it didn't count days properly.
-  Adjusted the timings for AutoHostRolling to make it more reliable.
-  AutoHostRolling will now button mash A from start of raid to when it closes the game. This gives about ~10 seconds of leeway for people to be late without killing the raid.

### First Release: 
-  DaySkipper_JP_Fast: A faster JPN skipper that runs up to 4700/hour.
-  DenRoller: A more generic den roller that rolls N days instead of 3.
-  AutoHostRolling: Roll N days, host raid, reset. Repeat.
